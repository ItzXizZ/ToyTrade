               This website was created by Ethan, a
        <br>   grade 8 St. Michaels University School student who, outside of school,
         <br>  enjoys programming websites, participating in Model United Nations conferences, playing tennis 
          <br> competitivley, and competing in + preparing for provincial math competitions. 
       <br><br>The event that gave the inspiration for this website took place two years prior;
          <br> Ethan's mom had picked him up from school and volunteered to drop of some used toys to an in-need family. 
          <br> Before hand, the children had chose the toys they wished to recieve, allowing for  
          <br> a more direct personal experience to occur. Consequently, after dropping off the toys, 
          <br> the joy present throughout the children's faces, while putting a smile on that of his own, 
          <br> caused the idea for ToyTrade to form within Ethan's mind.
          <br>
          <br> Ethan has numerous, more basic and less-aesthetically pleasing,
          <br> completed websites which he developed in prior years; 
          <br><br> These can be found in the github hosting links below:
