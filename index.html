        Many families struggle to feed, much less provide toys for their children. Children from other, more fortunate, families have grown out of, or have simply lost interest in, most of their childhood toys. This website is a local (Victoria, BC) start-up in which donators within the Greater Victoria Area may donate and provide toys for the less fortunate. Unlike its alternatives, our website solely accepts toys as donations and offers a unique feature, allowing in need families to submit item requests and offer extra detail, ensuring the best experience for the children receiving. Updates to the website will come weekly (Christmas update comming soon!!!). If you would like to provide a donation please click the "<a href="input12.html">Donate<a>" button and submit the form given. You will be asked to provide a pick-up location and pick-up time for the toys. If you wish to learn more about the creator of this website please click the "<a href="about.html">About<a>" Button. If you are looking for toys, please click the "<a href="want.html">Looking for Toys<a>" button. If you have any furthur questions or concerns, please click the "<a href="contact1.html">Contact<a>" button. <i>---Version 1.8</i>
